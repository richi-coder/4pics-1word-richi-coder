Redux Toolkit will manage state for the app game!

For doing it, it`s necessary to take into account the following:

1.- Game state
2.- Score state
3.- Level state


1.- Game state for last challenge:

const challenge = {
    "level": 1,
    "number": x,
    "imageURL": ["4 images"],
    "imageContent": ["men exercising", "woman riding"]
    "answer": "correct answer goes here!"
}
